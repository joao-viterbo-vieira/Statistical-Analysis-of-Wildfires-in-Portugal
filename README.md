# Wildfire Analysis in Portugal

## Overview

This project analyzes the relationship between socioeconomic factors and wildfire occurrences in Portugal. By examining data such as population density, average salary, and wildfire occurrences, we aim to uncover patterns and evaluate the impact of legislative changes, such as the 2017 wildfire prevention laws, on reducing fire incidents.

This analysis contributes to understanding how human activities and socioeconomic conditions influence wildfire risks and can guide the development of more effective prevention strategies.
